# Misc: Prior art

There's [calliope] and [slime] that brings Haml and Slim to Elixir, respectively. Expug offers a bit more:

- Jade syntax! - something I personally find more sensible than Slim.
- True multilines - Expug has a non-line-based tokenizer that can figure out multiline breaks.
- Correct line number errors - Errors in Expug will always map to the correct source line numbers.
