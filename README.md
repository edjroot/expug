# Expug

> Indented shorthand HTML templates for Elixir

Expug is a template language based on [Pug][] (formerly known as [Jade][]).
This is a [work-in-progress](docs/todo.md).

[Pug]: http://www.pug-lang.com/
[Jade]: http://jade-lang.com/

## Installation

Add expug to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  #[{:expug, "~> 0.0.1"}]
  [{:expug, git: "https://github.com/rstacruz/expug.git"}]
end
```

Also see [phoenix_expug](https://github.com/rstacruz/phoenix_expug) for Phoenix integration.

## The language

Expug lets you write HTML as indented shorthand, inspired by Haml, Slim, Pug/Jade, and so on.

```jade
doctype html
html
  meta(charset="utf-8")
  title Hello, world!
body
  a(href=@link)
    | This is a link
```
